# -GenZ-Career-Aspirations-Dashboard
This project uses real-time data and surveys to explore Generation Z's career goals, showing results in an Excel  Dashboard for easy understanding.



during my internship, I got to dig into what Gen-Z wants to do for a job. I didn't just stop there I made this cool thing called
an Excel Dashboard to show off what they're aiming for in their careers. 

When I say Gen-Z, I'm talking about those born
from the mid-1990s to the early 2010s. They're the ones just starting their work journeys and figuring out what jobs they're
into.

• Now, why does it matter what Gen-Z wants to be when they grow up? Well, it's a big deal for bosses, teachers, and people
who make the rules because it helps them understand what Gen-Z likes and expects from their jobs

. My project is like a peek into the future, showing what the next batch of workers is thinking. It's not just numbers and graphs; it's about helping
businesses get ready for this new group of workers who are about to hit the scene.

• I used this thing called an Excel Dashboard to make everything look cool and easy to understand. This project isn't just
about me exploring data; it's about helping businesses and teachers understand what's coming and how they can get ready
for it

• This project is like a guide for them, showing the way to be ready for the future workforce. So, it's not just a project; it's a
handy tool for everyone wanting to get a sneak peek into what's coming next in the job world!
